## 8. Cost Optimization Strategies

### 8.1 Infrastructure Optimization

**1. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Video for Small Meetings**
- **Implementation:** WebRTC mesh for meetings < 5 participants
- **Savings:** Eliminate TURN server costs (80% bandwidth reduction)
- **Impact:** $5-8/user/month savings
- **ROI:** Immediate (no infrastructure needed)

**2. Self-Hosted AI Models**
- **Transcription:** Whisper (OpenAI open-source)
- **Translation:** NLLB (Meta's open-source model)
- **Cost Comparison:**
  - Cloud AI: $0.024/min (transcription) + $0.10/min (translation) = $8.16/hour
  - Self-hosted: $0.50/hour (compute only)
- **Savings:** $7.66/hour → 94% reduction
- **Implementation:** AWS EC2 GPU instances (g4dn.xlarge @ $0.526/hour)

**3. Spot Instances for Processing**
- **Use Case:** Recording processing, AI inference
- **Savings:** 60-70% discount on compute
- **Caveat:** Non-critical workloads only (can tolerate interruption)

**4. CDN Optimization**
- **Current:** Cloudflare Pro ($20/month)
- **Scale:** Cloudflare Enterprise with volume discount
- **Alternative:** Fastly or AWS CloudFront with reserved capacity

**5. Storage Tiering**
- **Hot Storage (S3 Standard):** Recent recordings (30 days)
- **Warm Storage (S3 IA):** 30-90 days old
- **Cold Storage (Glacier):** 90+ days old
- **Savings:** 60-90% on older recordings

---

### 8.2 Pricing Optimization

**1. Usage-Based Pricing Components**

**Current:** Flat monthly fee
**Proposed:** Base + Overage model

```
Startup Pro: $59/month
- Includes: 20 hours of meetings
- Overage: $3/additional hour

Example:
- Light user (10 hours): $59 (no overage)
- Average user (25 hours): $59 + $15 = $74
- Heavy user (50 hours): $59 + $90 = $149

Revenue Impact: +25% ARPU from heavy users
```

**2. Feature-Based Add-Ons**

| Add-on | Price | Adoption | Revenue/User |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Extra Storage (50GB) | $10/month | 20% | $2.00 |
| Phone Dial-in | $15/month | 15% | $2.25 |
| Webinar Mode | $30/month | 10% | $3.00 |
| Advanced Analytics | $20/month | 25% | $5.00 |

**Potential Add-on Revenue: $12.25/user/month (+21% ARPU)**

**3. Annual Contract Incentives**

- **Discount:** 15-20% for annual prepayment
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduced churn
  - Improved cash flow
  - Predictable revenue
- **Target:** 60% of customers on annual plans

---

### 8.3 Free Tier Optimization

**Goal:** Reduce cost of free users while maintaining conversion funnel

**Strategy 1: Reduce Free Tier Limits**
```
Current:
- 5 meetings/month, 60 min each
- Cost: $0.75/user/month

Optimized:
- 3 meetings/month, 40 min each
- P2P only (no TURN server)
- Cost: $0.20/user/month
Savings: 73%
```

**Strategy 2: Time-Based Conversion Prompts**
```
- At 30 minutes: "Upgrade to continue beyond 40 minutes"
- At 2nd meeting: "1 meeting remaining this month. Upgrade for unlimited"
- After 3rd meeting: "Monthly limit reached. Upgrade to continue"

Target Conversion: 5% → 8% (60% improvement)
```

**Strategy 3: Feature-Gated Free Tier**
```
Remove from Free:
- Virtual backgrounds
- Screen sharing (keep basic sharing)
- Whiteboard
- Reactions

Result:
- Reduces feature usage (lower costs)
- Increases perceived value of paid tiers
- Maintains core value proposition (video calling)
```
