settings: {
  waitingRoomEnabled: waitingRoomEnabled || false,
  requireHostApproval: waitingRoomEnabled || false
}
```

**Backend Support**:

## Known Limitations (Healthcare Context)

### 1. Chat Messages Not E2E Encrypted
**Issue**: Chat is TLS-encrypted but server can access
**Recommendation**: Avoid sharing PHI (Protected Health Information) in chat
**Workaround**: Use video/audio for sensitive information

### 2. No Automatic HIPAA Compliance Certification
**Issue**: Platform provides tools, but compliance is user responsibility
**Recommendation**: Work with compliance team to configure properly
**Workaround**: Use compliance mode settings, train staff

### 3. No Built-in Electronic Health Record (EHR) Integration
**Issue**: Cannot directly integrate with Epic, Cerner, etc.
**Recommendation**: Use screen sharing to view EHR during consultation
**Roadmap**: EHR integration planned for future

### 4. No Prescription Writing
**Issue**: Platform does not include e-prescribing
**Recommendation**: Use existing e-prescription system
**Workaround**: Discuss prescriptions verbally, send via secure system

### 5. No Medical Device Integration
**Issue**: Cannot integrate with stethoscopes, vital monitors, etc.
**Recommendation**: Patient verbally reports vitals, or use separate telehealth devices
**Roadmap**: Device integration under consideration
