# Sangam Encryption Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Question**: "Do we have end-to-end encryption done?"

---

## Summary: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY TRUE**

The "End-to-End Encryption" claim is **accurate for video/audio** but **inaccurate for chat messages**.

---

## Detailed Analysis

### ✅ Video & Audio: TRUE E2E Encryption

**Status**: **FULLY ENCRYPTED (Peer-to-Peer)**

**How it works**:
- Uses WebRTC with SimplePeer library
- Media streams encrypted with **DTLS-SRTP** (industry standard)
- Truly peer-to-peer between participants
- Server only relays signaling (SDP/ICE), **cannot decrypt media**

**Evidence**:
```javascript
// frontend/src/services/webrtc.js:122-144
const peer = new SimplePeer({
  initiator,
  trickle: true,
  stream,
  config: {
    iceServers,
    sdpSemantics: 'unified-plan',
    iceTransportPolicy: 'all',
    bundlePolicy: 'max-bundle',
    rtcpMuxPolicy: 'require'
  }
});
```

**Encryption Details**:
- **DTLS** (Datagram Transport Layer Security) - Encrypts media channels
- **SRTP** (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) - Encrypts audio/video packets
- **AES-128 or AES-256** encryption by default in WebRTC
- Keys exchanged via DTLS handshake **between peers only**

**Verdict**: ✅ **ACCURATE** - Video and audio are genuinely end-to-end encrypted

---

### ❌ Chat Messages: FALSE - NOT E2E Encrypted

**Status**: **NOT ENCRYPTED END-TO-END**

**How it works**:
- Chat messages go through Socket.io server
- Server can **read, modify, and log** all chat messages
- Only protected by **TLS in transit** (HTTPS/WSS)
- Server performs profanity filtering (proof it can read messages)

**Evidence**:
```javascript
// backend/server.js:466-484
socket.on('chat-message', ({ roomId, message, userName }) => {
  // Profanity filter - SERVER CAN READ MESSAGES
  let filteredMessage = message;
  if (securityService.containsProfanity(message)) {
    filteredMessage = securityService.filterProfanity(message);
    securityService.logAction(roomId, 'PROFANITY_FILTERED', {
      userName,
      socketId: socket.id,
      originalMessage: message,  // SERVER LOGS ORIGINAL MESSAGE
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }

  // Server relays to all participants
  io.to(roomId).emit('chat-message', {
    socketId: socket.id,
    userName,
    message: filteredMessage,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
});
```

**What This Means**:
- Chat is **server-relayed**, not peer-to-peer
- Server has plaintext access to all messages
- Messages are logged in profanity filter
- Only encrypted in transit (TLS), not end-to-end

**Verdict**: ❌ **NOT E2E ENCRYPTED** - Chat messages pass through server in plaintext

---

### 🔒 Signaling: Server-Mediated (Not E2E)

**Status**: **ENCRYPTED IN TRANSIT (TLS), NOT E2E**

**What is Signaling?**
- SDP offers/answers (media capabilities negotiation)
- ICE candidates (network connection details)
- Room joining, participant lists

**How it works**:
- Exchanged via Socket.io through backend server
- Protected by **HTTPS/WSS** (TLS)
- Server can see **metadata**: who's connecting, when, room IDs

**Evidence**:
```javascript
// backend/server.js
// Server relays all WebRTC signaling
socket.on('offer', ({ to, offer }) => { ... });
socket.on('answer', ({ to, answer }) => { ... });
socket.on('ice-candidate', ({ to, candidate }) => { ... });
```

**Verdict**: ⚠️ **Metadata visible to server** (standard for WebRTC signaling servers)

## Privacy Policy Claims - Accuracy Check

### Claim 1 (Line 34 of Privacy.js):
> "Video, audio, and chat messages are transmitted peer-to-peer using WebRTC."

**Verdict**: ❌ **FALSE for chat**
- Video/audio: ✅ Peer-to-peer
- Chat: ❌ Server-relayed, NOT peer-to-peer

### Claim 2 (Line 51 of Privacy.js):
> "End-to-end encryption for peer-to-peer connections"

**Verdict**: ⚠️ **MISLEADING but technically defensible**
- If "peer-to-peer connections" only refers to WebRTC media: ✅ TRUE
- If users interpret this as "all data": ❌ MISLEADING

### Claim 3 (Line 52 of Privacy.js):
> "HTTPS/TLS for all data transmission"

**Verdict**: ✅ **TRUE**
- All Socket.io uses WSS (WebSocket Secure)
- Backend serves over HTTPS in production

---

## Website Marketing Claims

### Features Page Claim:
> "End-to-End Encryption: Military-grade encryption ensures your meetings remain completely private and secure."

**Current Status**: **OVERSTATED**

**Accurate Version Should Say**:
> "Secure Encryption: Video and audio are end-to-end encrypted using WebRTC DTLS-SRTP. All data transmission is protected with HTTPS/TLS."

**Why the change?**
- Current claim implies **everything** is E2E encrypted
- Reality: Only video/audio are E2E, chat is server-relayed
- "Military-grade" is marketing jargon with no technical meaning

---

## Comparison with Competitors

### Zoom
- Similar architecture: WebRTC E2E for media, server-relayed chat
- Offers optional E2E encryption mode (disables some features)

### Google Meet
- WebRTC E2E encryption for media
- Server can access chat (for features like translation)

### Signal (True E2E)
- All messages E2E encrypted (including chat)
- Server cannot read any content
- Uses Signal Protocol

**Sangam's Model**: Standard for WebRTC apps, **NOT full E2E like Signal**

---

## Threat Model Analysis

### What is Protected:
✅ Video content cannot be intercepted by server
✅ Audio content cannot be intercepted by server
✅ Video/audio cannot be intercepted by network attackers (DTLS-SRTP)
✅ Signaling protected from network attackers (TLS)

### What is NOT Protected:
❌ Server can read all chat messages
❌ Server knows who talks to whom (metadata)
❌ Server can log chat content (profanity filter proves this)
❌ Server could potentially inject/modify chat messages

### Attack Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Network Eavesdropper**
- ✅ **Protected**: Cannot decrypt video/audio (DTLS-SRTP)
- ✅ **Protected**: Cannot read signaling (TLS)
- ✅ **Protected**: Cannot read chat (TLS)

**Scenario 2: Malicious Server Operator**
- ✅ **Protected**: Cannot decrypt video/audio
- ❌ **Vulnerable**: Can read all chat messages
- ❌ **Vulnerable**: Can see all metadata (participants, times, rooms)

**Scenario 3: Government Subpoena**
- ✅ **Protected**: Cannot provide video/audio (not accessible to server)
- ❌ **Vulnerable**: Could be forced to log chat messages
- ❌ **Vulnerable**: Metadata available (who met with whom)

---

## Recommendations

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Fix Privacy Policy

**Current (INCORRECT):**
```
Video, audio, and chat messages are transmitted peer-to-peer using WebRTC.
```

**Should Be:**
```
Video and audio are transmitted peer-to-peer using WebRTC with end-to-end encryption.
Chat messages are relayed through our servers using encrypted connections (TLS).
```

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Update Website Features

**Current (MISLEADING):**
```
End-to-End Encryption
Military-grade encryption ensures your meetings remain completely private and secure.
```

**Should Be:**
```
Secure Encryption
Video and audio streams are end-to-end encrypted using industry-standard WebRTC (DTLS-SRTP).
All data transmission is protected with TLS encryption.
```

---

### 🟢 OPTIONAL: Implement True E2E Chat

If you want to claim full E2E encryption:

**Option 1: WebRTC Data Channels** (Peer-to-Peer Chat)
- Use WebRTC data channels for chat instead of Socket.io
- Truly peer-to-peer, server cannot read
- **Downside**: More complex, can have delivery issues

**Option 2: Client-Side Encryption** (Encrypted Chat Through Server)
- Encrypt chat messages on client before sending to server
- Use shared room key derived from WebRTC session
- **Downside**: Breaks server-side features (profanity filter, logging)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks for either option

---

## Final Verdict

### Question: "Do we have end-to-end encryption done?"

**Answer**:

✅ **YES for Video/Audio** - WebRTC provides true E2E encryption via DTLS-SRTP

❌ **NO for Chat** - Messages go through server in plaintext

⚠️ **Overall**: You have **partial E2E encryption**, which is standard for WebRTC apps, but **not full E2E like Signal or WhatsApp**.

---

## What to Tell Users

### Honest Version:
> "Sangam uses WebRTC technology to encrypt your video and audio streams end-to-end between participants. Our servers cannot access your video or audio content. Chat messages are transmitted through our servers using secure TLS encryption, which protects them from external attackers but allows us to provide features like profanity filtering."

### Short Version:
> "Video and audio are end-to-end encrypted. Chat messages are server-encrypted."

### Marketing Version (Accurate):
> "Secure, encrypted video conferencing with end-to-end encrypted media streams using industry-standard WebRTC technology."
