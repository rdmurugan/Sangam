## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create room" error:
- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify backend is running on Railway
- Check `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` in frontend/.env

### CORS errors:
- Make sure `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway matches Netlify URL exactly
- Include `https://` in the URL

### Video not working:
- Allow camera/microphone permissions
- Use Chrome or Firefox
- Make sure you're using HTTPS (Railway and Netlify do this automatically)

### Backend sleeping:
- Railway free tier may sleep after inactivity
- First request will wake it up (takes 10-20 seconds)
- Upgrade to Hobby plan ($5/month) for always-on

---

## Costs

**Current setup (Free tier):**
- Railway: 500 hours/month free
- Netlify: 100GB bandwidth/month free
- **Total: $0/month**

**If you exceed free tier:**
- Railway Hobby: $5/month
- Netlify Pro: $19/month (usually not needed)

## Making Updates

When you want to update your app:

```bash
# Make your changes to code
git add .
git commit -m "Updated features"
git push

# Both Railway and Netlify will auto-deploy!
```
